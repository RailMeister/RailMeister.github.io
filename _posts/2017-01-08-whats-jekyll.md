title: What's Jekyll?
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

You can use any __Markdown__ formatting that can be used with _GitHub Flavored Markdown_. You can do __BOLD__, _italic_, `code`, and others, like:
