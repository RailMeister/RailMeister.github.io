title: The Four Most Hurtful (and Funny!) Insults that Don't Use Curse Words
---

We've all been in a situation where we weren't allowed to cuss but we wanted to insult someone really bad. The problem is, like I said, that we weren't allowed to cuss. To solve that problem, I've come up with a list of the top four most hurtful and funny ways to insult somebody without using a single curse word. Why four? Four is different, and I like being different. Since I am learning Spanish, I will also give the Spanish translation for each insult. Here we go:

### 1: Two wrongs don't make a right, take your parents for example!

This one insults the target, the target's parents, and possibly even the target's sibling\(s\). _Powerful stuff!_

**Spanish Translation:** `¡Dos errores no hacen un bien, toma a tus padres por ejemplo!`


### 2: I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain it to you.

This is probably the most condescending insult on this list, as it is essentially calling its target a small child, while at the same time calling its target intellectually inferior.

**Spanish Translation:** `No tengo tiempo ni crayones para explicarte.`


### 3: Somewhere out there a tree is working very hard to replace the oxygen you consume. Now go apologize to it.

Wow. This insult is fun. It basically tells its target that they are a waste of time, and that they should be sorry for existing. This could be useful!

**Spanish Translation:** `En algún lugar, un árbol está trabajando muy duro para reemplazar el oxígeno que consumes. Ahora ve a disculparte.`


### 4: You are literally too stupid to insult.

Calling someone too stupid to insult is still an insult, and it's a pretty useful one. Say you want to insult a child, but they wouldn't understand any insults you know: This one covers that situation!

**Spanish Translation:** `Eres literalmente demasiado estúpido para insultar.`
